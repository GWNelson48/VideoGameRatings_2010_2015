I'm looking to see what the most popular games are in the 2010-2015 by Global_Sales vs Critic_Ratings.

At the very end of this Markdown I'll have a TLDR section that sums up all of my functions into one nice, neat little block of code.

First I'm going to get rid of anything with a NULL or NA value.

```{r}
edit1 <- Video_Games
edit2 <- na.omit(edit1)
```

A little roundabout, but I'm getting over the holidays and getting back into things and Googling how to do stuff in R.

Now let's filter out all the games prior to 2010.

```{r}
edit3 <- subset(edit2, Year_of_Release >= 2010)
```

Neat. We're narrowing it down. Let's also drop any games where the User_count is low. We'll drop anything under 100 users.

```{r}
edit4 <- subset(edit3, User_Count >= 100)
```

Quick recap, I've trimmed the original 16,928 rows down to 975 rows. 

Now it's time to drop a column because I do not care about the index number at all. I could do it by name but instead I'll do it by column number

```{r}
edit5 <- edit4[, -1]
```

The index is now gone forever. ...unless I go back to the original table.

Anyway, let's focus on our main goal.

We want the top rated games from 2010 to 2015 when this data set was completed. While we have Critic_Scores and Critic_Counts I'd rather focus on User_Score instead. 

It's time to drop more columns! Let's do it by name this time.

```{r}
edit6 <- edit5[, !names(edit5) %in% c("Critic_Score", "Critic_Count")]
```

Now that we're down to only User_Scores, let's drop every game that is rated below an 8.0 on what I assume is a 10 point scale.

On a side note, the Critic_Score was on a 100 point scale. They just have to be a little extra.

```{r}
edit7 <- subset(edit6, User_Score >= 8.0)
```

We are now down to the top user rated games. There are 274 of them. All of them have at least 100 users that reviewed the game.

I'm pretty confident in this data set now, but let's go ahead and see what further trimming does.

```{r}
edit8 <- subset(edit7, User_Score >= 9.0)
```

And that little edit has knocked us down to 14 rows. I think I'm going to need more data than that to work with. Let's jump back.

```{r}
edit8 <- subset(edit7, User_Score >= 8.5)
```

At 101 rows I think we're at a solid place to stop.

When I set up most of the functions together it looks like this:

```{r}
final <- Video_Games[, !names(Video_Games) %in% c("index", "Critic_Score", "Critic_Count")]
final2 <- subset(final, Year_of_Release >= 2010 & User_Count >= 100 & User_Score >= 8.5)
```

But can you see what I forgot?

I didn't remove the Null/NA values! And this gives me 104 rows because 3 games didn't have a rating marked down.

And one of those games is FromSoftware's Dark Souls III, so I'm keeping this as the final data set instead. Well, final2, but you get it.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
